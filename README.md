## Tinker custom topbar pink

![Topbar img](https://github.com/Insocz/Tkinter_custom_topbar_pink/blob/master/Custom_topbar.png)

    From this code you just need the CustomTitleBar class.

    If you want to customize your topbar just change thinks in CustomTitleBar.build
    just keep the names of self.canvis and self.close_button or change the bind.
    The window can not be resized, minimized or maximazed but it can be moved.
    You can styl use geometry so it can be resize with code.

    Just a note its best to use canvas in build because the move function will
    work with canvas.create_... but not with normal tk. ... 
    (well i would but you would need to add some code)
